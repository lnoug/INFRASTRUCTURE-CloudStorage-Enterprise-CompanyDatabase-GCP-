#1. Create a new project in the Google Cloud Console:

gcloud projects create [PROJECT_NAME] --name=[DISPLAY_NAME] --organization=[ORGANIZATION_ID]

Replace [PROJECT_NAME] with a unique name for your project, [DISPLAY_NAME] with a user-friendly display name, and [ORGANIZATION_ID] with the ID of your GCP organization.
This command creates a new GCP project with the specified name and display name, and associates it with the specified organization. The output will display the project ID of the newly created project.

#2. Enable the Cloud Storage API for your project:

gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com

This command enables the Cloud Storage API for your GCP project. The output will display a success message indicating that the API has been enabled.

#3. Create a Cloud Storage bucket to store your data:

gsutil mb -l [LOCATION] -p [PROJECT_ID] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

Replace [LOCATION] with the location where you want to store your data (e.g., us-central1), [PROJECT_ID] with the ID of your GCP project, and [BUCKET_NAME] with a unique name for your bucket.
This command creates a new Cloud Storage bucket with the specified name and location. The output will display a success message indicating that the bucket has been created.

#4. Set up access control to manage who can access your data:

gsutil iam ch [MEMBER]:[ROLE] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

Replace [MEMBER] with the email address or service account of the user or group you want to grant access to, [ROLE] with the desired Cloud Storage role (e.g., storage.objectViewer), and [BUCKET_NAME] with the name of your bucket.
This command grants the specified user or group the specified Cloud Storage role for the specified bucket. The output will display a success message indicating that the IAM policy for the bucket has been updated.
